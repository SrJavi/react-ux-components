# Start Development Environment

## Commands

The recommended workflow is to run TSDX in one terminal:

### yarn

```sh
yarn start
```

### npm

```sh
npm start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run either Storybook or the example playground:

### Storybook

Run inside another terminal:

```sh
yarn storybook
```

This loads the stories from `./stories`.
